      <description>And so, does the destination matter? Or is it the path we take? I declare that no accomplishment has substance nearly as great as the road used to achieve it. We are not creatures of destinations. It is the journey that shapes us. Our callused feet, our backs strong from carrying the weight of our travels, our eyes open with the fresh delight of experiences lived.</description>

      <description> Well you have a chance.  A chance nobody has had for ages, a chance in millions. Either you seize it and in doing so you decide you&amp;rsquo;re worthy, or you leave and give up. But as long as you keep trying there&amp;rsquo;s a chance. When you give up? That&amp;rsquo;s when the dream dies.
