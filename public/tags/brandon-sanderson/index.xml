      <description>And so, does the destination matter? Or is it the path we take? I declare that no accomplishment has substance nearly as great as the road used to achieve it.

      <description> Well you have a chance.  A chance nobody has had for ages, a chance in millions. Either you seize it and in doing so you decide you&amp;rsquo;re worthy, or you leave and give up. But as long as you keep trying there&amp;rsquo;s a chance. When you give up? That&amp;rsquo;s when the dream dies.
